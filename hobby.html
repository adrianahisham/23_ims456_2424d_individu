                    <h1><strong>Eat</strong></h1>
                    <p>
                        I love to eat! People who love food are always the best people, no doubt! As I mentioned earlier, if someone wants to make me happy, just give me food. In my opinion, when the stomach is full, the heart is glad. However, remember, do not overeat or you will be obese. Dont tell me I didnt tell you hehe. </p>

                    <h1><strong>Making Videos For Fun </strong></h1>
                    <p>
                        I always record some videos of my family and friends randomly because I am such a person who loves to look back at memories that I created with my beloved ones especially during Hari Raya Aidilfitri. I prefer videos than pictures because pictures cannot produce sound but videos can.</p>

                        <h1><strong>Travel </strong></h1>
                        <p>
                            I love travelling and exploring new places. Whenever I feel unmotivated, I will search a place to rest my mind so that I can feel myself alive back. I dont care about money. For me, you can always find money but you cannot buy experience. I care about my feelings a lot. By travelling, I can make myself happier than ever.</p>
